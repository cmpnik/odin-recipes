<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>For the Pizza Dough:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Allow it to sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
</ol>
<h3>For the Pizza Sauce:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a saucepan, combine crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Assembling and Baking:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to the highest setting (usually around 475째F/245째C).</li>
    <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it in half for two pizzas. Roll out each portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
    <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a border around the edges.</li>
    <li>Arrange slices of fresh mozzarella and tomato on top of the sauce. Add fresh basil leaves.</li>
    <li>Drizzle olive oil over the top and season with a pinch of salt.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.</li>
